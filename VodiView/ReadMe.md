# VodiView

## Abstract

A minimalistic (< 50 kB!) full screen image viewer (without any visible controls) that comes as a single executable ("portable").

## Usage

Put the EXE into the directory where the images are located and run it. It'll show the first image. Use mouse wheel or PageUp/PageDown to navigate through the images.

Alternatively, put the EXE to e.g. "C:\Progs" and use the windows function "Open with..." on image files and navigate to "C:\Progs\VodiView.exe".

## Features

* Press Esc to exit
* Press F1 to get a list of keyboard shortcuts
* Move the mouse to the upper right corner to make controls visible when in full screen mode
